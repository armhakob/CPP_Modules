# CPP_Modules

**CPP_Modules** is a collection of C++ programming modules designed to help learners master fundamental concepts in C++. These modules cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced concepts like memory management, data structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP). Each module provides exercises and examples to help solidify your understanding.

## About the Project

**CPP_Modules** contains 10 distinct modules (Module 0 to Module 9), each focused on a different core concept of C++. The project aims to provide learners with a hands-on approach to learning C++ by covering topics such as object-oriented programming, algorithms, memory management, data structures, and more.

## Modules Overview

Below is an overview of the modules included in this project:

- **Module 0**: Introduction to C++ basics, variables, and control structures.
- **Module 1**: Functions, scope, and control flow (if statements, loops, and more).
- **Module 2**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.
- **Module 3**: Memory management, pointers, references, and dynamic memory allocation.
- **Module 4**: Templates, exceptions, and advanced C++ features.
- **Module 5**: Data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Module 6**: Algorithms such as searching, sorting, and recursion.
- **Module 7**: Operator overloading, polymorphism, and virtual functions.
- **Module 8**: File I/O operations and working with streams.
- **Module 9**: Smart pointers, containers (vectors, maps), and modern C++ features.

Each module comes with detailed explanations, code examples, and exercises to help learners better understand the concepts.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Any C++ compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion, Code::Blocks).
- **Compilers**: GCC, Clang, or other C++ compilers.
- **Build System**: Makefile

## Installation

### Prerequisites
